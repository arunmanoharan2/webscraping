      "I would not recommend MDLive for their counseling services. My daughter felt she needed some anxiety support to deal with some college stress so we set up an appointment with MDLive since our BC/BS policy recommended it. On her first appointment with her therapist, the therapist never showed up. It was later discovered that her therapist thought the appointment was at 11am (my daughter's appointment was at 11:30). The therapist never realized her error and berated my daughter for not showing up on time via the messaging app and then closed it out so we couldn't reply. My daughter was already upset from her anxiety so this experience just added to it.We rescheduled with another therapist and that went smoothly, but the therapist had the flu and my daughter said that there was several times that the line went quiet when the therapist should have responded. My daughter got the impression she was muting her line so she could cough. At her third appointment with this second therapist, the therapist canceled her appointment 10 mins after it was supposed to start. No reason given, she just got an automated text message saying it was cancelled.  Will not use again and will not recommend it. \n",
